# ThatguyJK 2022 portfolio website

Every year (well, almost every) I like to take the time to apply a fresh coat of paint to my portfolio website. This gives me the perfect opportunity to try out new techniques, new technology, as well as show off things that I have done both professionally and personally. 

For this years iteration of my website I am looking forward to showcasing a lot more WebGL animations and 3D renderings as well as a couple of Web3 (Ethereum Smart Contracts) projects that I have put together. In terms of the Web3 stuff, an idea I am looking forward to implementing (once I get the actual concept buttoned down) is an old-school style guest book feature except, instead of your typical database, the blockchain will be responsible of recording records of visitors. 

#### Technology used in the creation of this website

- React/NextJS
- ThreeJS
- CablesGL
- ethers.js
    > This is for the blockchain functionality mentioned above
