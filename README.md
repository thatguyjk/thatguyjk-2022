# ThatguyJK 2022-2024 portfolio website

Every year (well, almost every) I like to take the time to apply a fresh coat of paint to my portfolio website. This gives me the perfect opportunity to try out new techniques, new technology, as well as show off things that I have done both professionally and personally.  

#### Technology used in the creation of this website

- React, NextJS, Contentful

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
